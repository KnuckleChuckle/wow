0.35

clamp_grad: on

clamp_max: 1 <--- this is pretty high but, this notebook allows for insane values like this.  I keep this value high so that It creates details with the fast movements, or just to ensure that it creates details with a high frame_skip %, a value of 1 like this would work well for 80% frame skip, which is what our turbo frames use.
